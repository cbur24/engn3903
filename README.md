# ENGN3903 - Environmental Sensing, Mapping and Modelling
This repository has the practical sessions that will demonstrate the fundamentals of remote sensing. The notebooks complement the weekly lectures and are set to follow them as closely as possible.

We will use Google Earth Engine as the main platform, but be aware that there are other platforms that are equally capable (e.g. Geoscience Australia's [Digital Earth Australia](link), Microsoft's [Planetary Computer](link)).
